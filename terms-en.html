<h1>Terms of Use</h1>

<p>By using the <strong>AutoY</strong> application, you agree to these Terms of Use. Please read them carefully before using our services.</p>

<h2>1. Use of the Service</h2>
<p>AutoY allows users to publish, browse, and manage car listings. You agree to use the application legally and respectfully.</p>

<h2>2. Account Creation</h2>
<p>When creating an account, you must provide accurate information. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your login details and for all activities carried out through your account.</p>

<h2>3. Published Content</h2>
<p>You are solely responsible for the content you publish (listings, photos, descriptions). AutoY reserves the right to remove any content that does not comply with the law or these terms.</p>

<h2>4. Account Deletion</h2>
<p>You may delete your account at any time from the application settings. Deleting your account will remove all associated personal data.</p>

</ul>

<p>For paid listings:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The first listing is free; additional listings require payment.</li>
  <li>By paying for a listing via IAP, the user agrees that AutoY reserves the right to reject the listing if it does not meet the app’s requirements or contains incorrect information (e.g., invalid phone number, inappropriate content).</li>
  <li>Refunds cannot be handled by AutoY: any refund request must be submitted directly to Apple (“Report a Problem” via your Apple account).</li>
</ul>

<p>Once the payment is completed, you will receive a confirmation directly from Apple. Any error or technical issue must be reported immediately to AutoY at:  
<a href="mailto:AutoYcars@outlook.com">AutoYcars@outlook.com</a>.</p>

<p>Refunds, cancellations, or disputes are handled according to Apple’s policies and local laws.</p>

<h2>6. Liability</h2>

<h2>7. Data Protection</h2>
<p>Information collected during the use of the application and payments made via IAP is processed in accordance with our <a href="https://yassinebenaissa1988-bot.github.io/AutoY-Legal/privacy-policy-fr.html" target="_blank">privacy policy</a>. Payment data is never stored on our servers and is handled exclusively by Apple.</p>

<h2>8. Modifications</h2>
